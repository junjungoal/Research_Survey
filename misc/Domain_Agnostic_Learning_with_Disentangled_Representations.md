## What

Proposed a new task of Domain-Agnostic Learning, which deals with how to transfer knowledge of labeled data to arbitrary target source.

In previous works

- single source -> single source
- multiple sources -> single source

This implies that those make a strong assumption that the target data is sampled from the same distribution. 

Proposed Deep Adversarial Disentangled Autoencoder (DADA) aiming to tackle domain agnostic learning by disentangling the domain-invariant features from both domain-specific and class-irrelevant features simultaneously. 

Class disentanglement is to remove the class-irrelevant features
