## What

Deep reinforcement learning algorithms requires many millions of interactions to attain human-level performance, on the other hand, human can exploit highly rewarding nuances of an environment upon first discovery. In the brain, this rapid learning is thought to depend on the hippocampus and its capacity for episodic memory. This work investigated whether a simple model of hippocampal episodic control can learn to solve difficult sequential decision-making tasks.
