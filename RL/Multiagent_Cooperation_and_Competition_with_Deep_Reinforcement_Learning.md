## What
Extension of Deep Q-learning to multi-agent environments.


## How

## Result



## Conclusion

In fully competitive environment, the agents overestimate their future discounted rewards. The realistic reward expectation of two equally skillful agent should be around zero, but  in most game situations both of Deep Q-Networks predict rewards near 0.5. This overestimation is known bias of the Q-learning algorithm and could potentially be remedied by using the novel Double Q-learning algorithm.
