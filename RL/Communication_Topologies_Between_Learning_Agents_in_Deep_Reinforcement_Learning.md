## What
Showed that arranging learning agents in less than fully connected topologies can improve learning.
Communication topology resulted in exploration, higher overall maximum reward, and higher diversity of solutions in high-dimensional optimization problems.

In Evolution Strategies, the gradient is the average over the difference in parameters, on the contrary, the gradient for an agent is still the average over difference in parameters but only over agents that are connected in Networked Evolution Strategies.
